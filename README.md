# KNN_with_Python
I first created python script that only takes values for features & do calculation of ID3 but without storing data.

ðŸ§  K-Nearest Neighbor Web App (Streamlit)
In Streamlit app, I ended this problem & let users train a custom knn model with one or more features. Users can enter feature names and values, train the model and make real-time predictions. The app displays Information Gain(IG) & choose root node for max IG variable. No pre-uploaded dataset requiredâ€”users manually input data for full control and learning. Ideal for students and beginners to understand how knn works step-by-step. But, Can also be used to make some predictions.
